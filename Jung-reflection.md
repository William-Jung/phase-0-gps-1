# GPS 1.1 Reflection

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Prior to the session I was struggling with knowing when to add and stage files. I was also confused about the differences between forking, cloning, pushing, and pulling and knowing when to do what.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
During the GPS we went over those concepts that we were struggling with. My partner and I both asked critical questions to help clarify those things. We didn't fully comprehend the differences still with forking and cloning, but I think I have a good idea. I know now that you should add and commit early and often. I think with more practice those things should become pretty intuitive. Our guide did say that with GitHub, a lot of it is much clearer when known. In other words, once we practice and build that muscle memory, we probably won't even realize how we were confused in the first place.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
We asked our guide to explain the differences between forking and cloning, and pushing and pulling. For the most part, those questions were answered and I felt more comfortable about them as the week went on. I asked my pair questions that would help us with the challenges and for the most part we just kept it assignment-oriented, like what does driving and navigating mean to you, what happens if you were to do this, what could we do next time, etc.

**What still confuses you about Git?**
Since the GPS, I haven't come up with any new questions on my own. I suppose it will just take some more tinkering and building muscle memory.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
My first experience of pairing in a GPS was very helpful. I think my pair and I both asked questions that we wouldn't have thought of on our own. I felt that our guide stayed in the background for the most part, but was always there when we were about to be taken way off track. I think it was very useful practice for the challenges that we had to complete this week.
